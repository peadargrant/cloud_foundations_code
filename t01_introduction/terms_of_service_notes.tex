\section{Service agreement}\label{service-agreement}

Cloud Providers will offer their services as part of a service
agreement, which specifies a number of promises, limitations and
obligations:

\begin{description}
\item[Promises]
are guarantees by the cloud provider of things it will do for the
customer.
\item[Limitations]
limit the scope of the promises that a cloud provider makes to a
customer.
\item[Obligations]
specify rules that a customer must comply with when using the cloud
service.
\end{description}

\section{Costs}
\label{sec:costs}

Metered costs for cloud usage depend on the particular service under
discussion. Broadly, these will break down into:

\begin{table}
